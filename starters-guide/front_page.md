# Computer Vision with Mirte

This chapter of the guide will focus on understanding the basics of Computer Vision using Mirte. Only the following is needed to follow this Tutorial:

* A Mirte bot that is already setup
* Duckietown configured in the way you want it
* The web-interface

The first and the last one should already be present if you followed earlier steps in the guide. We will not go in depth on how the Mirte bot works and how to use it as that is already explained in earlier parts of the guide. This section will solely focus on getting started with Computer Vision.
