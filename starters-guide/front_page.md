# Introduction

This is the introductary guide for working with Mirte and getting started with your first program.
This guide will go into the basic setup and some basic step for letting the Mirte bot drive around in the town.
Before starting this guide is important that you have at least the following:

* The website interface where Python and Blockly can be written
